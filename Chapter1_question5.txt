/**
 * This class is the solution to q5, chapter1 in Mark ALlen Weiss'
 *  *  textbook "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis"
 *
 *  The question reads: Write a recursive method that returns the number of 1’s in the binary representation
 * of N. Use the fact that this is equal to the number of 1’s in the representation of N/2,
 * plus 1, if N is odd.
