/** In this class, we solve a word search puzzle ( chapter1, question2 in Mark ALlen Weiss'
 *  textbook "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis")
 *
 *  In this class, I have prepared an array of words. These words are placed into a 2dimensional array,
 *  and then the remaining empty spaces are filled with random letters.
 *
 *  The board is then displayed to the user on System.out.
 *
 *  The method "solve word search" then finds each word in the word search, and displays to System.out the 2x2 array with just the
 *  letters belonging to found words visible.
