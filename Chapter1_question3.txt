/** This is a class that represents the solution to question 3, chapter 1 in Mark ALlen Weiss'
 *  textbook "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis"
 *
 *  The question asks us to: Write a method to output an arbitrary double number (which might be negative)
 * using only printDigit for I/O.
 *
 *
 * FIRST: I will modify the textbooks example of printing out a positive integer ( I will make the method print out negative ints as well as positive )
 *
 * Solution written by : Andrew Pauls
 * Computer Science major @ Brock University, Ontario, Canada
 * Date: June 25, 2022
 * Dedicated to otty

    /** This method works by:
     * checking if the integer we pass is greater than 10.
     * If it is, we call the method again with the original number divided by 10
     * This will continue to take place until we have a number that is greater than
     * zero but less than 10.
     * At this point, we print out the first digit mod 10,
     * meaning that we print the remainder
     * The recursive calls of course close in reverse order, printing each following number
     *
     * Question...Don't we get decimals really quickly?
     * Answer to myself: Yes, technically. Java will automatically round to int tho
