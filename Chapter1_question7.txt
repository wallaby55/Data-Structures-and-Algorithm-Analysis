// Note that this is a simple mathematical proof and does not require computing

/**
 *
 * a)  log X < X for all X > 0
 *     Sol. If 0 < X < base, then the base is greater than X.
 *     If ( base > X ), and ( X > 0 ), then the log of X must be negative,
 *     for the base has to be put to a negative exponent to amount to X.
 *
 *     If  ( X = base ) , the result is 1. If we were at this point attempting to
 *     complete this proof where the base could be any positive value, the proof would
 *     be impossible, for log(base 0.5) of 0.5 would be 1, and 1 !< 0.5
 *
 *     Assuming that the question wants us to prove for log(X) where base is always 2,
 *     we see that if base = X we have a result of 1, and 1 < 2
 *
 *     In the final case where X is greater than 2, the base is less than X,
 *     meaning that base^y is 2 times itself as many times as is needed to equate to
 *     X. If 2 is multiplied against itself as many times as a number X which is larger than 2,
 *     2 has doubled as many times as the number itself - which is absurd.
 *
 *
 *
 * b)  log(A ^B ) = B log A
 *     logA = y
 *     y^B
