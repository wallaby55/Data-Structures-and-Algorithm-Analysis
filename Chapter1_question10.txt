This file contains the solution to question 10 in chapter 1 of Mark ALlen Weiss'
textbook "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis".

The question reads:

What is 2^100 (mod 5)?

My solution:
Immediately one sees that computing 2^100, and then taking mod5 will return the correct answer.
2^100 = 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376
The above value, mod5 = 1 ( which is obvious from the final digit being a 6 )
This solution is extremely elementary and I suspect not at all what we were supposed to come up with.
There is likely a very simple proof to show that the answer is 1. 
I am satisfied with my efforts for now however.
