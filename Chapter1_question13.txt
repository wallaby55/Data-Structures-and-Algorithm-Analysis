     *  *  textbook "Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis"
     *
     * The exercise reads:
     * Design a generic class, Collection , that stores a collection of Object s (in an array),
     * along with the current size of the collection. Provide public methods isEmpty ,
     * makeEmpty , insert , remove , and isPresent . isPresent(x) returns true if and only if
     * an Object that is equal to x (as deÔ¨Åned by equals ) is present in the collection.
